\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we propose FPGA-accelerated power simulation with linear power modeling,
which enables fast and accurate power analysis.
The linear power model not only approximates the power consumption with the RTL signal swathing activities,
but reduces the signal set to be watched. 
FPGA simulation make it possible to obtain the selected signal activities quickly.
The power model and the activity counter values from FPGA simulation are used for the detailed power analysis of the target design.

In the future, we will add counters to the target design and evaluate the linear power model with signal activities from FPGA simulation. 
We also plan to model DRAM power with event counters and integrate it with the counter structure to analyze the entire SoC power.
